Please watch this youtube [video](http://youtu.be/NQY3aOp-Rp4) for usage instrutions


#**Note**
> Please note that the default markup provided by the form component relies on bootstrap and it's classes for styling. If you rely on it, you must make sure that bootstrap is loaded for it to be properly styled. .

### Other things to Note so you understand functionality
1. Questions do not disappear, its just that they do get reassigned to another group when you use the add link.
2. When a group has no questions, it wont show up in the component list of faq groups.
3. When you use the remove link, questions are unattached from their current group and are groupless, use the add link to add them to a group.
